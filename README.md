# Diffusion Models From Scratch

Diffusion models are a type of deep learning architecture that simulates a diffusion process to generate new samples, such as images or text, from random noise. This repository is based on the content of the "Diffusion Models from Scratch in PyTorch" video available on YouTube. The aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of how diffusion models work and to enable experimentation with variations of this architecture.
